# How to use Slurm

In this page we'll list some common Slurm interactions to run, cancel or monitor jobs.

## How to monitor jobs

### Monitor the status of cluster's nodes
The command `sinfo` can be used to monitor the state of each node, including partitions, time limits, state, and names of the nodes in that partition:

```bash
$ sinfo
PARTITION       AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
admin              up   infinite      3   idle node[120-122]
department_only    up 7-00:00:00     18   idle node[103-105,112-114,116,123-124,126,130,132-135,137-139]
students*          up 1-00:00:00      7   idle node[106-111,122]
```

??? note "Node states"

      For a full list of the meaning of each state, [refer to Slurm's official docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html#SECTION_NODE-STATE-CODES). Some of the common states are:
      
      - `*`: the node is presently not responding and will not be allocated any new work;
      - `ALLOCATED`: the node has been allocated to one or more jobs;
      - {`DOWN`, `DRAINED`, `FAIL`, `INVAL`}: the node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically place nodes in this state if some failure occurs, so inform an admin ASAP;
      -  `DRAINING`: the node is currently allocated a job, but will not be allocated additional jobs;
      - {`IDLE`, `MIXED`}: the node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use;
      - `UNKNOWN`: the Slurm controller has just started and the node's state has not yet been determined.

### Monitor the state of jobs
The command `squeue` can be used to view information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue, including job ID, partition, name, user, state, execution time, node name:

```bash
$ squeue
JOBID   PARTITION   NAME    USER    ST  TIME    NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
326     debug       sleep   guest   R   0:03    1       node123
```

??? note "Job states"

      The `ST` column shows the states of the jobs. For a full list of the meaning of each state, [refer to Slurm's official docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#SECTION_JOB-STATE-CODES).
      Some of the common states are:

      - {`BF`, `F`, `NF`, `PR`}: the job has failed to launch or complete;
      - `OOM`: the job experienced out of memory error;
      - `R`: the job is running; 
      - `CG`: the job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.

## How to submit jobs

### How to submit a non-interactive job

A non-interactive job can be run using `srun <commands>`. 
You have to remember to use the `-p` or `--partition` flag, alongside the requirements of the job.

A job with no requirements can be run without further arguments:
```bash
$ srun -p <partition> bash -c "echo 'It works! My name is:'; hostname"
It works! My name is:
node116
```

A job with certain requirements needs all necessary resources to be specified: 
```bash
$ srun -p <partition> --gpus=2 bash -c "echo 'It works! Here is a summary of my GPUs:'; nvidia-smi"
It works! Here is a brief of my GPUs:

```

Read [Slurm's official docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html) for a list of all the available flags. 
Some common requirements are the following:

- `--gpus`: the minimum number of GPUs the node must have to run the job;
- `--mem`: the real memory required per node, in MBs;

### How to submit a non-interactive container

You can do it using Singularity.
An interactive job can be run using `srun singularity run <container_path> <commands>`.

In this example, the `hostname` command will be executed into the `pytorch` container run on a node:

```bash
$ srun singularity run docker://pytorch/pytorch:2.6.0-cuda12.6-cudnn9-devel hostname
INFO:    Using cached SIF image

```
### How to submit an interactive container

You can do it using Singularity.
An interactive job can be run using `srun --pty singularity shell <container_path>`, where the `--pty` flag spawns a pseudo-terminal.

In this example, the `pytorch` container will be executed on a node with 2 GPUs. 
The `--nv` flag tells Singularity to mount the GPUs:

```
$ srun --gpus=2 --pty singularity shell --nv docker://pytorch/pytorch:2.6.0-cuda12.6-cudnn9-devel
INFO:    Using cached SIF image

## How to cancel jobs
### Cancel a job by its job ID
A particular job can be canceled using the `scancel <job_id>` command:

```bash
$ squeue
JOBID   PARTITION   NAME    USER    ST  TIME    NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
326     debug       sleep   debug   R   0:03    1       node123
$ scancel 326
$ squeue
JOBID   PARTITION   NAME    USER    ST  TIME    NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
```

### Cancel all the jobs of a user
All the jobs of a user can be canceled using the `-u` or `--user` flag, by typing `scancel --user <user_id>` command:

```bash
$ squeue
JOBID   PARTITION   NAME    USER    ST  TIME    NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
326     debug       sleep   debug   R   0:03    1       node123
$ scancel --user debug
$ squeue
JOBID   PARTITION   NAME    USER    ST  TIME    NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
```
